# ticket-machine
Project made for the recruitment process with usage of Vue, TypeScript, Sass, and docker (with docker-compose).
The main purpose was to mimic the ticket machine, allow to manually chose the station with hints which letter is available to pick next.
Data fetched from the server and parsed after choice of letter, next available letters were highlighted and possible stations results were shown.

## Project setup
```
npm install or docker-compose up 
```

## What can be done more?
```
More tests can be written, especially some E2E tests.
The usage of the store is also a good idea here.
```


Hope you will enjoy
